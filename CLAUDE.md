# GratefulGPT Development Guidelines

## Project Vision
GratefulGPT is the first of its kind - a specialized language model dedicated to honoring the legacy of the Grateful Dead and everything it stands for. Our mission is to create the most comprehensive source for Grateful Dead knowledge, preserving and sharing the rich history, music, culture, and philosophy of this legendary band.

**We Welcome Contributions & Collaborations**
This groundbreaking project thrives on community participation. Whether you're a Deadhead, AI researcher, developer, or simply passionate about preserving cultural heritage, your contributions and collaborations are always appreciated. Together, we can build something truly special that captures the spirit of the Grateful Dead community.
