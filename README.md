# Format your prompt
prompt = "Human: What's the meaning of life?\nAssistant:"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate response
outputs = model.generate(
    inputs,
    max_length=200,
    temperature=0.7,
    do_sample=True,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```
